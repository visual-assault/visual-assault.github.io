Since 2004 visual assault has been designing and building a wide range
of web sites, apps and tools for fortune 500 companies, innovative startups
and contributing to open source projects. We advise, advise, design,
implement optimize and maintain.

visual assault is an affinity group of responsible people who take pride
in our work and take our lives seriously. We are not a "work hard/play
hard" organization.

We believe that success is not measured by monetary wealth or position
within a corporate hierarchy; but by the quality of our association
amongst equals and by our measure of self-actualization.

We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care
of ourselves, our families, our partners, and each other. We aim for a
sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to
maximize long-term performance, while retaining clarity of vision.

Our mission is to build worthwhile things that might last; and give them
back to the open-source community.
