visual assault is an affinity group of responsible people who take pride
in our work and take our lives seriously. We are not a "work hard/play
hard" organization.

We believe that success is not measured by monetary wealth or position
within a corporate hierarchy; but by the quality of our association
amongst equals and by our measure of self-actualization.

We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care
of ourselves, our families, our partners, and each other. We aim for a
sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to
maximize long-term performance, while retaining clarity of vision.

Our mission is to build worthwhile things that might last; and give them
back to the open-source community.
